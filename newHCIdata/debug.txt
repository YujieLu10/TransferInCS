In one exemplary embodiment, the GUI is displayed as a band around a perimeter of a horizontally oriented interactive display surface. The user input controls can be made to reorient in response to an application that provides control, or a user can selectively cause the GUI to move relative to the interactive display surface to enable the user to gain access to a specific that was previously disposed at a different point. The user input can be received directly from the orientable GUI in the form of finger movement detected by the interactive display surface and the reorientation of the GUI can be controlled according to the laws of physics, based on the user input.', 'title': 'Orientation free user interface', 'kind': 'B2', 'num_claims': 15, 'withdrawn': 0, 'assignee_id': '0264c98c-8311-429a-b561-d8b9fa122dd5', 'assignee_name_first': nan, 'assignee_name_last': nan, 'organization': 'Microsoft Technology Licensing, LLC'}], 'inventors': [{'inventor_id': 'coemfb65nmqg0eg4hr1ojzdvu', 'inventor_name_first': 'Charles R', 'inventor_name_last': 'Billow', 'male_flag': 1.0, 'attribution_status': 1}, {'inventor_id': 'coemfb65nmqg0eg4hr1ojzdvu', 'inventor_name_first': 'Charles R', 'inventor_name_last': 'Billow', 'male_flag': 1.0, 'attribution_status': 1}, {'inventor_id': 'coemfb65nmqg0eg4hr1ojzdvu', 'inventor_name_first': 'Charles R', 'inventor_name_last': 'Billow', 'male_flag': 1.0, 'attribution_status': 1}, {'inventor_id': 'fl:gr_ln:richterdemedeiros-1', 'inventor_name_first': 'Gretchen', 'inventor_name_last': 'Richter de Medeiros', 'male_flag': 0.0, 'attribution_status': 1}, {'inventor_id': 'fl:gr_ln:richterdemedeiros-1', 'inventor_name_first': 'Gretchen', 'inventor_name_last': 'Richter de Medeiros', 'male_flag': 0.0, 'attribution_status': 1}, {'inventor_id': 'fl:gr_ln:richterdemedeiros-1', 'inventor_name_first': 'Gretchen', 'inventor_name_last': 'Richter de Medeiros', 'male_flag': 0.0, 'attribution_status': 1}]}, '8135602': {'patent_info': [{'country': 'US', 'date': '2012-03-13', 'abstract': 'Techniques for delivering data for coordinating multiple party use of a facility include producing conditions data by measuring without human intervention current condition of a facility that is used by multiple human parties.

The system includes a display surface on which graphic images are displayed, one or more scanning light sources configured for scanning the interactive display surface, and a light detector configured for detecting light reflected from an object that is adjacent to or in contact with the interactive display surface. A computing system storing machine instructions is in communication with the scanning light source and the light detector. When executed, the machine instructions cause the computing system to illuminate the interactive display surface with the scanning light source, to detect light with the light detector that is reflected from an object after illumination with the light source, and to generate an output signal based on the detected light that has been reflected from an object on or adjacent to the interactive display surface.', 'title': 'Input method for surface of interactive display', 'kind': 'B2', 'num_claims': 20, 'withdrawn': 0, 'assignee_id': '0264c98c-8311-429a-b561-d8b9fa122dd5', 'assignee_name_first': nan, 'assignee_name_last': nan, 'organization': 'Microsoft Technology Licensing, LLC'}], 'inventors': [{'inventor_id': 'fl:da_ln:yee-19', 'inventor_name_first': 'Dawson', 'inventor_name_last': 'Yee', 'male_flag': 1.0, 'attribution_status': 1}, {'inventor_id': 'fl:da_ln:yee-19', 'inventor_name_first': 'Dawson', 'inventor_name_last': 'Yee', 'male_flag': 1.0, 'attribution_status': 1}, {'inventor_id': 'fl:da_ln:yee-19', 'inventor_name_first': 'Dawson', 'inventor_name_last': 'Yee', 'male_flag': 1.0, 'attribution_status': 1}]}, '8670632': {'patent_info': [{'country': 'US', 'date': '2014-03-11', 'abstract': 'Effects of undesired infrared light are reduced in an imaging system using an infrared light source.
