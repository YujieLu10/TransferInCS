; TODO:
; 1. @hancheng conference id list (SIGCHI https://sigchi.org/conferences/upcoming-conferences/) @yujie paper cited by patent percentage
7678/57385 13.37%
; 2. citation-wise filter pcs raw data (keep wherefound = both or bodyonly), and then aggregate in paper-wise （对于最最开始的raw data(所有pcs) 方便计算下总共有百分之多少的paper被bodyonly和both类别cite过嘛）
42822459, both 4515991, bodyonly 13007040, frontonly 25299427
